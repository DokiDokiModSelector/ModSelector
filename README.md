# Welcome to the Future of Mod Selection

The Doki Doki Mod Selector is a mod that imitates Akinator style behaviour to choose a mod based on your preferences.

## The Plan.

If you're planning on working on a project like this it's important to have a plan. Here's some steps that we need to take before we can even start coding:

✅ Basic Mod List

✅ Categories

❌ First Variable List

❌ Question Writing

❌ Low Level Scripting

❌ Finishing Touches

**If you believe you would be good at helping with one of the unfinished parts, make a pull request with any of your changes!**
